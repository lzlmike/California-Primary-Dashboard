For part3, I chose homeowner/renter as the model to predict the votes.
First of all, I wrote a request function in the browser, which is in my request.js. 
It get called when the page refreshed or loaded. The client then received the request, and call another function to get the API data request from server. And the data will be returned in the callback in server. Then the data will returned to browser with a callback function. After that we can modify the page with the data we get.My model shows that Hillary may get more votes and Delegates according to my prediction.
